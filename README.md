"Advanced SQL Project - Online  Food Delivery System"
This project is part of an advanced SQL challenge organized by DataPencil and guided by Kalyani Bhatnagar maâ€™am. Special thanks to everyone involved for supporting me throughout this journey, helping me sharpen my SQL skills, and allowing me to showcase my analytical mindset.

This project focuses on building advanced SQL queries, reports, and visualizations for an Online Food Delivery App. The concepts learned here will serve as foundational skills for my career in data analytics.

ðŸ“… Project Journey & Concepts Learned
Day 1: SQL JOINs, Aggregations, and Filtering

JOINs across 2â€“4 tables

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

Aggregation functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, DISTINCT

Sorting and filtering logic

Day 2: Conditional Logic & Aggregations

CASE WHEN for conditional logic

Table joins across customers, orders, and restaurants

Aggregation using COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY

Sorting and filtering for clean reports

Day 3: Subqueries

Inner subqueries in WHERE, SELECT, and FROM clauses

Day 4â€“5: Window Functions

ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()

Aggregates over windows: SUM() OVER, AVG() OVER, COUNT() OVER

Running totals & customer activity trends

Partitioning & ordering within window functions

Tracking first/last orders, most loyal customers, and daily order trends

Day 6: SQL Views

Creating views for reusable queries

Simplifying complex reporting

Day 7: Temporary Tables

Creating temp tables for intermediate results

Managing multi-step queries efficiently

Cleaning up temporary data

Day 8: Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Defining CTEs with WITH cte_name AS (...)

Chaining multiple CTEs for step-by-step logic

Reusing CTEs within queries

Beginner-friendly non-recursive CTEs and an introduction to recursive CTEs

Day 9: Advanced SQL â€“ Joins + CTEs + Aggregation + Ranking

Combining multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN

Using CTEs to layer business logic

Advanced aggregations for KPIs (revenue, orders, customer activity)

Applying ranking functions for leaderboards & trends

Creating production-ready SQL reports

Day 10: Stored Procedures & Automation

Creating stored procedures for repeatable business logic

Passing parameters for dynamic results

Automating multi-step queries like revenue reports and customer searches

Reusing procedures across different reports

Day 11â€“12: Practice

Reinforcement of all previously learned concepts

Day 13â€“14: Visualization & Reporting

Visualizing query results

Creating a final report using Canva

Summarizing daily learnings into a cohesive document
